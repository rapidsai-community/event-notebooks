## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all allowed contributors. Please be respectful and professional in all interactions.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to event-notebooks:

- **Report bugs**: If you find a bug, please open an issue with detailed information
- **Suggest enhancements**: Have an idea for a new feature? Let us know!
- **Improve documentation**: Help us make the docs clearer and more comprehensive
- **Submit code**: Fix bugs, implement features, or improve performance
- **Share examples**: Contribute notebooks, examples, or use cases

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- CUDA-capable GPU (for GPU-accelerated features)
- NVIDIA PyTorch container or equivalent CUDA environment

### Setting Up Your Docker Development (Recommended)

For a consistent development environment with all GPU dependencies, please install the [latest RAPIDS NGC Notebooks container release, found in the release selector](https://docs.rapids.ai/install/#selector) , :

```bash
docker run --gpus all --pull always --rm -it \
    --shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 \
    -p 8888:8888 -p 8787:8787 -p 8786:8786 \
    nvcr.io/nvidia/rapidsai/notebooks:26.06-cuda13-py3.14
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pre-commit install
git clone https://github.com/your-username/event-notebooks.git
cd event-notebooks
```
#### Break down of the code (in no particular order)
1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/event-notebooks.git
   cd event-notebooks
   ```

2. **Install uv (if not already installed)**

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   `
3. **Install Development Dependencies**

   ```bash
   uv sync --extra dev
   ```

   This automatically creates a virtual environment and installs the project in editable mode along with development tools like `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, and `pre-commit`.

4. **Set Up Pre-commit Hooks**

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

   This will automatically run code formatting and linting checks before each commit.

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with the following specifications:

- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **String quotes**: Use double quotes for strings
- **Import ordering**: Managed by `isort` with Black profile

### Code Formatting

All code must be formatted with:

- **Black**: For consistent code formatting
- **isort**: For import statement ordering

Run formatters before committing:

```bash
uv run black .
uv run isort .
```

Or let pre-commit hooks handle it automatically.

### Linting

We use `flake8` for linting. Run it with:

```bash
uv run flake8 src/
```

### Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules
- **Type hints**: Include type hints for function parameters and return values
- **Comments**: Write clear comments explaining complex logic

Example:

```python
def optimize_portfolio(
    returns: np.ndarray,
    risk_measure: str = "cvar",
    confidence_level: float = 0.95
) -> dict:
    """
    Optimize portfolio allocation using specified risk measure.

    Args:
        returns: Historical returns data as numpy array
        risk_measure: Risk measure to use ('cvar' or 'variance')
        confidence_level: Confidence level for CVaR calculation

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing optimal weights and performance metrics

    Raises:
        ValueError: If risk_measure is not supported
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

Please run all notebooks to ensure that both the code, cell outputs, and written instructions are correct before submitting a PR

## Submitting Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:

- `feature/description` - for new features
- `bugfix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```
Short summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
Explain what changes were made and why.

- Bullet points are okay
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issues: "Fixes #123" or "Relates to #456"
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork** with the latest changes from main:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run all checks** before submitting:

   ```bash
   uv run black .
   uv run isort .
   uv run flake8 src/
   uv run pytest
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of what and why
   - Link to related issues
   - Screenshots or examples if applicable

4. **Address review feedback** promptly and professionally

5. **Ensure CI passes** - all automated checks must pass

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows style guidelines (Black, isort, flake8)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] New tests added for new features
- [ ] Documentation updated (docstrings, README, etc.)
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive
- [ ] No merge conflicts with main branch
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks pass

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
